# Runbook

Operational procedures for the `bazzite-tower` image. There is no server to deploy —
the "deployment" is a bootc image the target machine rebases onto. Day-2 operations
are install, update, **rollback**, health-check, triage, and the CI publish pipeline.

Image: `ghcr.io/bearyjd/bazzite-tower:latest` · signed with `cosign.pub`.

## Install / switch

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/bearyjd/bazzite-tower:latest
sudo systemctl reboot
```

From any bootc host (Bazzite, Bluefin, Aurora, Silverblue, Fedora Atomic). Bazzite's
policy enforces signature verification against `cosign.pub`. See
[README "Installing"](../README.md#installing).

## Update

Bazzite applies image updates in the background. Force one immediately with:

```bash
sudo bootc upgrade
sudo systemctl reboot
```

`:latest` rebuilds weekly (Sun 06:00 UTC) and on every push to `main`.

## Rollback (do this first when a boot goes bad)

```bash
sudo bootc rollback        # stage the previous deployment
sudo systemctl reboot
```

Or pick the previous entry in the GRUB boot menu at power-on. To **freeze** on a
known-good build instead of tracking `:latest`, switch to a date-stamped tag:

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/bearyjd/bazzite-tower:latest.YYYYMMDD
```

Tag scheme (`latest`, `latest.YYYYMMDD`, `YYYYMMDD`, `<short-sha>`):
[README "Tags"](../README.md#tags).

## Health checks

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| Current/rollback deployment, signature | `bootc status` |
| Suspend mode actually in effect | `cat /sys/power/mem_sleep` (bracketed entry is active; expect `[s2idle]`) |
| SOF audio ABI matches kernel | `journalctl -k -b 0 \| grep -E "Topology: ABI\|Kernel ABI"` (the two must match); offline: `/usr/libexec/bazzite-tower-sof-abi` |
| CPU MCE / RAS summary | `sudo ras-mc-ctl --summary` · `sudo ras-mc-ctl --errors` |
| Running CPU microcode revision | `grep -m1 microcode /proc/cpuinfo` (and `journalctl -k \| grep -i microcode`) |
| Tracked kernel args applied (no dupes) | `cat /proc/cmdline` — expect each tracked karg exactly once (IOMMU, `kvmfr.static_size_mb=128`, `vfio_pci.disable_vga=1`, `kvm.ignore_msrs=1`, `nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=0`) |
| NVMe SMART health / self-tests | `sudo smartctl -H /dev/nvme0` · `/dev/nvme1`; smartd warnings + scheduled tests: `journalctl -u smartd` |
| Swappiness in effect | `sysctl vm.swappiness` (expect `10`) |
| Indexer excludes applied | `balooctl6 config show excludeFilters` (expect `.gradle`, build/cache dirs) |
| Virt stack up | `systemctl is-active virtqemud.socket` · `virsh -c qemu:///system list --all` |
| Default NAT network | `ujust vm-net-status` |
| Wi-Fi diagnostics (offline) | `ujust wifi-debug` |

CI mirrors these: `tests/smoke.sh` (offline, the gate) and `tests/boot-check.sh`
(runtime). See [docs/CODEMAPS/ci-cd.md](./CODEMAPS/ci-cd.md).

## Common issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Wi-Fi gone after a rebase | stale `wifi.backend=iwd` with iwd not enabled | the `wifi-backend-guard` service auto-recovers on boot; inspect with `ujust wifi-debug` |
| `virtqemud` won't start | upstream change dropped the `qemu` system user | rebuilt/guarded in `build.sh`; the smoke + boot tests catch regressions |
| Can't manage VMs as your user | user not yet in `kvm`/`libvirt`/`docker` | `ujust fix-vm-groups`, then re-login (the first-boot oneshot adds the first user automatically) |
| Display flicker / ~30s sluggish wake | i915 PSR/DC or `deep` suspend on Meteor Lake | baked kargs disable PSR/DC and pin `s2idle`; verify `cat /sys/power/mem_sleep` |
| No audio; card profile `off`; journal floods with `FW reported error: 9` | SOF topology ABI newer than the kernel's SOF driver ABI | `build.sh` auto-resolves `alsa-sof-firmware` to an ABI-≤3.23 build and gates it in CI; verify with `/usr/libexec/bazzite-tower-sof-abi` vs `journalctl -k \| grep "Kernel ABI"` |
| Frequent corrected MCEs in the journal | corrected CPU **cache** errors on Meteor Lake (EDAC `igen6` ECC counters 0/0 → not DRAM) | `rasdaemon` records/decodes them; `mcelog` is masked (its trigger tried to offline a CPU). Decode with `sudo ras-mc-ctl --errors` |
| `smartd` warns of media errors / available-spare drop | NVMe wear or developing fault | `journalctl -u smartd`; confirm with `sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvmeN`; a falling available-spare or rising media-error count is an escalation/back-up signal |
| Secure Boot refuses the image | — | the image kernel is signed with the shared ublue MOK (already enrolled on ublue/Bazzite hosts); no MOK work needed when switching ublue↔bazzite-tower |

## Audio: SOF firmware ABI pin

The on-board Intel HDA/SOF analog codec needs a firmware **topology** whose ABI is
no newer than the kernel's SOF driver ABI. The 7.0 kernel here is at ABI **3.23**;
stock `alsa-sof-firmware` moved to **3.29**, which can't be instantiated (`FW
reported error: 9` / `failed widget list set up`) — WirePlumber then re-links the
dead sink ~10×/s until PipeWire sets the card profile to `off`.

- **Fix in the image:** `build_files/build.sh` **auto-resolves** `alsa-sof-firmware`
  at build time — it walks the available builds newest→oldest, inspects each
  candidate's actual `.tplg` ABI, and installs the newest whose ABI is ≤
  `KERNEL_SOF_ABI_*` (3.23). It then **fails the build** if the installed topology
  ABI somehow still exceeds the kernel's. `tests/smoke.sh` re-asserts the ABI
  offline; `tests/boot-check.sh` fails on the storm signatures. Nothing to hand-pin.
- **Seatbelt:** `…/wireplumber.conf.d/90-tower-sof-backoff.conf` shortens the
  SOF node's idle/error suspend window so a future regression degrades to one dead
  route instead of a journal storm. It is not a substitute for the resolved build.
- **Lifting the pin** when a future kernel advances its SOF ABI is a single edit:
  bump `KERNEL_SOF_ABI_MAJ/MIN` in `build.sh` (and the matching constants in
  `tests/smoke.sh`) to the new `journalctl -k | grep "Kernel ABI"` value — the
  resolver then auto-selects a newer firmware. Check a `.tplg`'s ABI by hand with
  `/usr/libexec/bazzite-tower-sof-abi <path-to-sof-tplg>`.

## CPU MCEs (corrected cache errors)

This Meteor Lake CPU logs corrected machine-check events (~115/boot observed) that
are **CPU cache**, not DRAM — EDAC `igen6` ECC counters stay at 0/0. `rasdaemon`
collects and decodes them; `mcelog` is masked.

```bash
sudo ras-mc-ctl --summary    # counts by type since boot
sudo ras-mc-ctl --errors     # decoded per-event detail (bank, address, type)
```

Reading the result:

- **Corrected** errors spread across cores/cache ways are common and generally
  benign — the CPU corrected them and continued.
- Corrected errors **localized to a single core / cache line** that recur are a
  possible RMA signal; capture `ras-mc-ctl --errors` over several boots.
- **Any _uncorrected_ MCE is an escalation** — treat as failing hardware: save the
  decode, and roll back / power down rather than continue.

Microcode: `microcode_ctl` is layered at the latest Fedora revision in `build.sh`.
Early-load takes effect once the initramfs is regenerated (on a base bump); confirm
the running revision with `grep -m1 microcode /proc/cpuinfo`.

## Module blacklists (lean boot)

`…/modprobe.d/blacklist-unused-gpu.conf` blacklists **amdgpu** / **amdxcp** — there
is no AMD GPU on this machine, and no display path (including DisplayPort-alt over
USB-C/Thunderbolt, which the Intel iGPU drives) depends on them. `xe` is left
loaded on purpose. Revert by deleting the file. If `lsmod | grep amdgpu` still
shows it loaded after a rebase, it's initramfs-embedded — add the kernel arg
`rd.driver.blacklist=amdgpu` (new kargs.d fragment) as the stronger lever.

## Tuning defaults (swappiness, indexer)

- `…/sysctl.d/99-tower-swappiness.conf` sets `vm.swappiness=10` (zram was filling
  while RAM was free). Override at `/etc/sysctl.d/`; verify `sysctl vm.swappiness`.
- `/etc/xdg/baloofilerc` seeds baloo's `exclude filters` with build/cache trees
  (`.gradle`, `target`, `build`, language caches; `node_modules` is already a baloo
  default). It only seeds new users — a user's `~/.config/baloofilerc` overrides it.
  Re-index after editing with `balooctl6 disable && balooctl6 enable`.

## Publish pipeline (operator view)

`build.yml`: build → **smoke gate** → push GHCR → cosign sign **by digest**. The gate
runs before login/push, so a broken image never reaches `:latest` (it stays last-good).
Each guard workflow opens — and later auto-closes — a labelled tracking issue:

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED:ci-labels (from .github/workflows/) -->
| Label | Workflow | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ci-failure` | `build.yml` | build or smoke gate failed; nothing published |
| `boot-test-failure` | `boot-test.yml` | image built but misbehaved at runtime |
| `base-bump` | `base-watch.yml` | upstream base changed a blast-radius package |
| `iso-failure` | `build-iso.yml` | titanoboa live/installer ISO build failed |
<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED:ci-labels -->

## CI secrets

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED:secrets (from .github/workflows/) -->
| Secret | Required | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | auto | GHCR push; open/close tracking issues (provided by Actions) |
| `SIGNING_SECRET` | optional | cosign private key — sign image by digest (`build.yml`) and ISO sign-blob (`build-iso.yml`). Unset → signing step skipped |
| `S3_PROVIDER`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | optional | rclone upload of disk/ISO artifacts (`build-disk.yml`, `build-iso.yml`). Unset → artifact-only |
<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED:secrets -->

Rotate `SIGNING_SECRET` by generating a new cosign keypair, updating the repo secret,
and committing the new `cosign.pub`.

## Verify a published image

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/bearyjd/bazzite-tower:latest
```

## Disk / ISO artifacts

- `build-disk.yml` (dispatch) → qcow2 via bootc-image-builder → artifact or S3.
- `build-iso.yml` (dispatch, Sun 08:00 UTC) → titanoboa live/installer ISO,
  Secure-Boot-bootable → checksum + cosign sign-blob → artifact or S3. Build internals:
  [docs/CODEMAPS/iso-build.md](./CODEMAPS/iso-build.md).
